        <p>
          <strong>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</strong> is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML.<br>
          CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>
          CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.<br>
          This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics,
           enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content.
        </p>
        <p>
          Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices.<br>
          CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.
